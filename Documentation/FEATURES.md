# Feature Engineering Documentation

## Overview

Our model uses **21 carefully engineered features** across 5 categories to predict next-day customer spending (`net_gbp`).

---

## Feature Categories & Rationale

### ✅ **Used Features** (21 total)

#### **1. Base Features** (2 features)
Current day metrics that capture transaction volume:

| Feature | Description | Business Logic |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `orders` | Count of distinct invoices | More orders = higher spending |
| `items` | Sum of absolute quantities | More items = higher basket size |

**Rationale**: Direct indicators of customer activity level.

---

#### **2. Temporal Features** (3 features)
Calendar-based patterns:

| Feature | Description | Business Logic |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `day_of_week` | 0=Monday, 6=Sunday | Shopping patterns vary by weekday |
| `day_of_month` | 1-31 | Payday effects (beginning/end of month) |
| `is_weekend` | 1 if Sat/Sun, 0 otherwise | Weekend shopping behavior differs |

**Rationale**: Customer spending shows temporal patterns (e.g., weekend spikes, month-end purchases).

**Example**: Retail customers often spend more on weekends.

---

#### **3. Rolling Window Features** (4 features)
3-day moving aggregates to capture recent trends:

| Feature | Description | Business Logic |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `rolling_3d_mean_net` | Avg spending last 3 days | Recent spending trend |
| `rolling_3d_std_net` | Spending volatility | Customer consistency |
| `rolling_3d_max_net` | Peak recent spending | Potential ceiling |
| `rolling_3d_sum_orders` | Total recent orders | Purchase frequency |

**Rationale**: 
- **Mean**: If customer spent £100/day for 3 days, likely to continue
- **Std**: High volatility = unpredictable customer
- **Max**: Indicates spending capacity
- **Orders**: Frequent purchasers likely to return

**Why 3 days?** 
- With 5 days of data, 3-day window balances recency vs. data availability
- In production with more data, could expand to 7-day, 14-day, 30-day windows

---

#### **4. Lag Features** (6 features)
Previous day values to capture momentum:

| Feature | Description | Business Logic |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `lag_1d_net_gbp` | Yesterday's spending | Strong predictor (recency) |
| `lag_1d_orders` | Yesterday's order count | Recent activity level |
| `lag_1d_items` | Yesterday's item count | Recent basket size |
| `lag_2d_net_gbp` | 2 days ago spending | Short-term pattern |
| `lag_2d_orders` | 2 days ago order count | Activity trend |
| `lag_2d_items` | 2 days ago item count | Basket trend |

**Rationale**: 
- **Recency effect**: Recent behavior is strongest predictor
- **Momentum**: Customers on buying sprees continue
- **Pattern detection**: 2-day lag helps identify trends

**Example**: Customer who spent £200 yesterday likely to spend similar amount tomorrow.

**Why not 7-day lag?**
- Dropped due to limited data (5 days total)
- In production, would add 7d, 14d, 30d lags

---

#### **5. Customer Lifetime Features** (4 features)
Historical customer behavior:

| Feature | Description | Business Logic |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `customer_total_orders` | Cumulative orders (excluding today) | Customer loyalty |
| `customer_total_spend` | Cumulative spending | Customer value |
| `customer_days_active` | Days since first purchase | Customer tenure |
| `customer_avg_order_value` | Average spend per order | Customer tier |

**Rationale**:
- **Total orders/spend**: High-value customers spend more consistently
- **Days active**: Long-term customers more predictable
- **Avg order value**: Separates premium vs. budget customers

**Example**: Customer with 50 historical orders and £5,000 lifetime spend is more predictable than new customer.

---

#### **6. Derived Features** (2 features)
Calculated ratios and metrics:

| Feature | Description | Business Logic |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `avg_items_per_order` | items / orders | Basket density |
| `returns_ratio` | returns_gbp / gross_gbp | Return behavior |

**Rationale**:
- **Items per order**: High = bulk buyers, Low = single-item purchases
- **Returns ratio**: High returns = lower net revenue

**Example**: Customer with 10 items/order is bulk buyer, likely higher spending.

---

## ❌ **Features NOT Used** (and why)

### **Category Proportions** ❌
**Example**: `pct_electronics`, `pct_clothing`, `pct_home_goods`

**Why not included:**
- Would require `product_category` aggregation per customer per day
- Adds 5-10 features (one per category)
- **Trade-off**: Complexity vs. benefit
  - ✅ **Pro**: Captures customer preferences
  - ❌ **Con**: Sparse with limited data (5 days)
  - ❌ **Con**: Many customers have 1-2 categories only

**When to add:**
- With 30+ days of data
- If categories show strong predictive power
- If customer segmentation is important

**Implementation example:**
```python
# Group by customer, date, category
category_spend = df.groupby(['date', 'customer_id', 'product_category'])['net_gbp'].sum()
# Calculate proportions
category_pct = category_spend / category_spend.groupby(['date', 'customer_id']).sum()
```

---

### **Advanced Recency Features** ❌
**Example**: `days_since_last_purchase`, `purchase_frequency_30d`

**Why not included:**
- Already captured by `customer_days_active` and lag features
- Would be redundant
- Limited value with only 5 days of data

**When to add:**
- With 60+ days of data (to calculate 30/60 day frequencies)
- For churn prediction models

---

### **Seasonal/Holiday Features** ❌
**Example**: `is_holiday`, `days_until_holiday`, `month`, `quarter`

**Why not included:**
- Not applicable to 5-day dataset (no seasonal variation)
- Would add noise without signal

**When to add:**
- With 365+ days of data
- For retail/e-commerce with strong seasonality

---

### **Customer Segment Features** ❌
**Example**: `customer_segment` (High/Medium/Low value), `rfm_score`

**Why not included:**
- Requires clustering/segmentation analysis
- Limited historical data (5 days) insufficient for stable segments

**When to add:**
- After 30+ days to establish stable segments
- Using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis

---

### **Product-Level Features** ❌
**Example**: `avg_product_price`, `unique_products_purchased`, `product_diversity`

**Why not included:**
- Already captured by `items` and `avg_items_per_order`
- Product-level granularity may overfit with small dataset

**When to add:**
- If product recommendations are needed
- With larger datasets (1000+ products)

---

### **Cross-Customer Features** ❌
**Example**: `pct_rank_spending` (vs. all customers), `is_top_10pct_spender`

**Why not included:**
- Requires comparing across all customers
- May not generalize well to new customers

**When to add:**
- For relative ranking/competitive analysis
- In mature systems with stable customer base

## Feature Engineering Decisions

### **Why These Features Work**

1. **✅ Rolling Averages (3-day)**
   - Captures recent spending trends
   - Smooths daily volatility
   - Good for small datasets

2. **✅ Recency (Lag 1d, 2d)**
   - Yesterday's spending is strongest predictor
   - Captures buying momentum
   - Works well with limited history

3. **❌ Category Proportions (Not used)**
   - Too sparse with 5 days of data
   - Many customers have 1 category only
   - Would add in production with 30+ days

## Feature Engineering Best Practices

### **✅ What We Did Right**

1. **Avoid data leakage**: All features properly lagged (no future information)
2. **Handle missing values**: Fill NaN with 0 (conservative approach)
3. **Business logic**: Each feature has clear reasoning
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add features as data grows
5. **Interpretability**: Features are explainable to stakeholders

### **🔄 What Could Be Improved** (with more data)

1. **More lag depths**: Add 7d, 14d, 30d lags
2. **Longer rolling windows**: Add 7d, 14d, 30d windows
3. **Category features**: Add product category proportions
4. **Interaction features**: Combine features (e.g., weekend × orders)
5. **Non-linear features**: Polynomial features for key predictors

## How to Add New Features

### **Example: Adding Category Proportions**

```python
def create_category_features(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Add product category proportion features.
    
    For each customer per day, calculate % of spending in each category.
    """
    # Get category spending per customer per day
    category_spend = df.groupby(['date', 'customer_id', 'product_category'])['net_gbp'].sum()
    
    # Calculate total spending per customer per day
    total_spend = df.groupby(['date', 'customer_id'])['net_gbp'].sum()
    
    # Calculate proportions
    category_pct = (category_spend / total_spend).reset_index(name='pct')
    
    # Pivot to wide format (one column per category)
    category_wide = category_pct.pivot_table(
        index=['date', 'customer_id'],
        columns='product_category',
        values='pct',
        fill_value=0
    )
    
    # Rename columns
    category_wide.columns = [f'pct_{col.lower()}' for col in category_wide.columns]
    
    return category_wide
```

Then add to `get_feature_columns()`:
```python
category_features = [
    'pct_electronics',
    'pct_clothing', 
    'pct_home',
    # ... etc
]
all_features += category_features
```
